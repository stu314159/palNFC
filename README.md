Numeric Fluid Channel Application using the Palabos LBM library

This application will simulate external flow over objects described by an STL file.  The velocity, vorticity and pressure field will be calculated as well as forces exerted on the surfaces of the object.  This is based on a subset of the functionality used in the Palabos example code: generalExternalFlow.
